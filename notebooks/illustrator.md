# Basic editing
+ Resize the canva: use the [artboard tool](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/12904/how-to-change-artboard-size-in-ai-cs6) or resize the page on the artboard property following [this tutorial](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Artboard-Size-in-Adobe-Illustrator). This is helpful to generate correct page (like for poster making) size or remove white space when exporting to eps or pdf format.
+ Cut a part of image off from a bigger one for later usage: use the Clipping Mask tool following [this tutorial](http://www.dummies.com/software/adobe/illustrator/how-to-create-a-clipping-mask-in-adobe-illustrator-cs6/) or [this](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/clipping-masks.html). In short, once the correct shape of mask is put on top of the parent image, select both layers with `shift` key, the clipping mask tool can then be applied from `Object > Clipping Mask > Make`.
