# Basic editing
+ Short-cuts for Duplicate, Clone and Copy/Paste: see [this](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-duplicate-clone-or-copy-and-paste--cms-19969). Duplicate is `Control + D`.
+ To create customized shapes and objects, [path](https://fedoramagazine.org/inkscape-creating-and-editing-paths/) in Inkscape is worth learning to use.
+ Change background color: open `File/Document settings` (shift+ctl+D) and select the color from the `Color/Background` tab. Use `FF` in the transparence setting of the RGB color picker to make the color solid (`00` means completely transparent).
+  Cut down an object in a particular shape mask: see [How do I crop in Inkscape?](http://goinkscape.com/how-to-crop-an-image-in-inkscape/) or [this](http://goinkscape.com/how-to-crop-in-inkscape/). The Clip and Mask tools can be used for this purpose.
